# Tweet From A Quiet Place
A Python script that lets you Tweet without visiting the Twitter website or using the App.

## How To Use
First, you need access to the Twitter API by becoming a developer, and then you need to create a Twitter app. I recommend following [this guides](https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/) for all of these steps.

After you've put in all of the authentication keys and credentials into the Tweet.py file, as shown in the guide, you can start tweeting.

Write your Tweet in the Twee.txt file and run the script.

It will check if your Tweet is short enough and then ask you to confirm the send. 

That's it.
